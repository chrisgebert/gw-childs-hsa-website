# gw-childs-hsa-website

HTML pages for [`gwchildshsa.org`](https://gwchildshsa.org)

I'm using the [Binary template](https://templated.co/binary/) from templated.co for now, with plans to connect the template to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) layouts that will generate and publish a static version of the site with each update made.
