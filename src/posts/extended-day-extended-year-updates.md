Early in the summer of 2024, the Mayor's office announced that G.W. Childs would be one of the schools in the pilot program for the 2024-2025 school year. Details have been scarce until now but with the start of the school year, they are starting to take shape.

### Current Status

1. [GPCA](https://gpca-phila.org) is providing after-care programming at the school just as they had during last school year. This is and will be optional, and families do not need to participate if they don't want to.
2. More slots for after-care will become available as GPCA and the school understands the demand.
3. If you want to register for after-care, you can pick up a registration packet in the main office. Or you can contact GPCA at ericarobinson@gpca-phila.org

### Future Plans

1. GPCA will also start offering before-care programming at the school, which will begin at 7:30am on school days. They are currently offering 36 slots to start but are planning to offer more to meet the demand.
2. This before-care is also optional, and families do not need to participate if they don't want to.
3. If you're interested in before-care, pick up a registration packet in the main office or contact GPCA to let them know.

### Additional

1. Camp and other enrichment opportunities will become available throughout the school year. GPCA may provide camps during Winter and Spring Breaks.
2. Other opportunities for students, like intramural sports and partnerships with programs like Students Run Philly Style, Joyful Readers, and Philadelphia Arts in Education, will continue with more information as it becomes available.
3. If you have an idea for an extracurricular program you'd like to see offered at G.W. Childs, please let the HSA know.
