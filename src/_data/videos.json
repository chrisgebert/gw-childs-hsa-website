  "description": "Children of all ages need a safe, secure, and loving environment to do well. Positive parenting reduces the stress of parenting and makes parenting more rewarding and enjoyable. The premise of Triple P is to do no harm to our children. For us, that means to do no harm physically, mentally, or spiritually -- which will be highlighted within the workshop. Our hope is to build a culture of Positive Parents.\nPresented by Turning Points for Children\n\nQuestions? Pyetje? 问题？សំណួរ? Perguntas? Вопросы? ¿Preguntas?

  "description": "Many parents and educators have asked, “How do I cultivate a love of reading in an unmotivated reader?” This workshop takes an in-depth look at the correlation between reading and developing an extensive vocabulary, which is shown to determine intellectual ability and academic success in school. “The Four Keys to Cultivating a Love for Reading” are introduced: 1) Creating a Culture, 2) Reading Profile, 3) Engagement Appeal, and 4) Motivation. Finally, to cap off the workshop, a role-playing activity, followed by a parent-child accountability contract is introduced to ensure a solid commitment to cultivating a love of reading.\nPresented by DBA Personal Safety & Educational Development\n\n How to Inspire Every Child To Be a Lifelong Reader, Alvin Irby - TED Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERSZb2wHFDw \n\nQuestions?
