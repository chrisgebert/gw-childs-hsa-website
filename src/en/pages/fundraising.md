# Fundraising
We are committed to providing a great educational experience and we invite you to be a part of this commitment through out fundraising initiatives.

## Why Fundraising Matters

Funds raised play a crucial role in enhancing resources, activities, and overall school improvements. By contributing, you have a direct impact on the quality of education and opportunities available at G.W. Childs.
