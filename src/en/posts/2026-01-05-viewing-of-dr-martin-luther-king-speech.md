### Viewing of Dr. Martin Luther King Speech

Please join the school community and alumni of Barratt/Childs school for a viewing of the historic speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King in the very auditorium where it occurred in 1967.

The viewing will take place on Monday, January 19th, 2026 at 10am. All are invited to join us in honoring this important part of our school's history, and to be part of the day of service which will follow the viewing.
