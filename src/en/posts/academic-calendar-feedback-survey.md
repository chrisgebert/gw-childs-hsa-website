The School District of Philadelphia is reaching out to our community for feedback on the proposed academic calendars for the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 school years. They're looking to create calendars that support student learning while also meeting the needs of students, families, and staff.

Find the Academic Calendar Feedback Survey here: [https://www.research.net/r/TQQQZ96](https://www.research.net/r/TQQQZ96)

Key points:

1. The Feedback Survey is now open for all stakeholders.
2. The survey allows participants to review potential calendar options and share their preferences.
3. An Academic Calendar Committee, comprising district staff, principals, and union leaders, will review all responses.
4. The process aims to develop equitable calendars that adhere to Pennsylvania Department of Education requirements and collective bargaining agreements.
5. Regular updates on the calendar development process will be available on the district's [Academic Calendar website](https://www.philasd.org/calendar/#1677103226740-b94e55a5-1991).
6. Final calendar proposals will be presented to the Board of Education for voting in January 2025.

Stakeholders are encouraged to complete the survey and check the Academic Calendar website regularly for updates as the process unfolds.
