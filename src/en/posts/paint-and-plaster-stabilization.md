The District is conducting evening maintenance work starting October 30th to address damaged paint and plaster in three classrooms. EPA-certified contractors will handle the two-day project, which aims to minimize potential lead exposure in the pre-1978 building. Third-party environmental consultants will verify the safety of all spaces before students and staff return, ensuring no disruption to normal school activities.

For lead prevention information, contact Philadelphia's Lead Prevention Unit at 215-685-2788 or visit the city's lead prevention website: [https://www.phila.gov/guides/lead-guide](https://www.phila.gov/guides/lead-guide)
