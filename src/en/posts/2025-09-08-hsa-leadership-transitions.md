## HSA Leadership Transitions

President Alicia Gonzalez has stepped down for personal & professional reasons. When she is not bringing new life into this world as a Doula and mom of 3, she will still be actively involved in the school community as her schedule permits.

Moving into the vacancy as President will be Erica Johnston. Erica has served as HSA Secretary for two terms, is the parent of a lovely 2nd grader and a proud educator to English Learners. She is thrilled & honored to serve the Childs school community in this new role!

Moving into the vacancy as Secretary will be Mimi Ballard. Mimi has two wonderful sons at Childs - a 2nd grader & kindergartener - and has been supporting our school with Bake Sales, Open Houses, Kindergarten Playdates and the Chalk the Walk event. Mimi may be new to the Board, but she's been happily & quietly helping behind the scenes for years. We are thrilled to have her on the team!

Melissa Inzaris and Matthew Vincent will retain their respective roles as Vice President and Treasurer. All 4 members of the HSA Board are thrilled to meet with you all at Back to School Night & share exciting plans for the 2025-2026 school year!

Thanks to Principal Malone and other school leaders, we now have our own HSA office space (Room 115 across from the School Library) that we are looking to evolve into a shared resource center. Come visit the space at Back to School Night!
