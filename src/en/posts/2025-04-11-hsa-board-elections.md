### Board Elections

The HSA will be holding elections for the next 2-year term. Positions are President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer. Once we have a nominating committee in place, we can work with the Home & School Council to conduct the elections.

Nominees for all positions are welcome!

If you want to learn more about the positions or the election process, you can contact gwchildshsa@gmail.com, or submit a response to the form below that Erica created.
